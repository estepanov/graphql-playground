# Lesson One

This is lesson of GrpahQL it includes a verry simple implementation using [express](http://expressjs.com 'Official express server website'), [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql 'Official express-graphql GitHub repo'), and a JavaScript based implementation [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js 'Official GitHub repo for JS GraphQL')

This sample uses a fixed array of objects and lodash to filter. For simplicity we utilize [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash 'Official lodash GitHub repo') to filter our fake user data that is stored in an array.

The primary point of this lesson is an introduction to GraphQL and its schema.
