#GraphQL Lesson

For heavily data dependent applications, GraphQL is an excellent tool. This is a repo I made as I follow various guides and lessons from around the internet. Please note it is primarily based on JavaScript and so the following libraries are used throughout the project:

* [express](http://expressjs.com 'official express server website')
* [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql 'official express-graphql GitHub page')
* [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js 'Official GitHub repo for JS GraphQL') _(JavaScript refrence implementation)_
