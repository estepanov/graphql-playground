# GraphQL Playground

For heavily data dependent applications, GraphQL is an excellent tool. This is a repo I made as I follow various guides and lessons from around the internet. Please note it is primarily based on JavaScript and so the following libraries are used throughout the project:

* [express](http://expressjs.com 'official express server website')
* [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql 'official express-graphql GitHub page')
* [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js 'Official GitHub repo for JS GraphQL') _(JavaScript refrence implementation)_

## Basic Repo Info

Every lesson folder is a seperate node project. This means you will need to install depenencies individually on a per-lesson basis. This should allow for a simple comparison to see how things change.

_Each lesson has a readme file that describes what is going on in the lesson. The code that is added to each lesson has comments that are specifically for that lesson, so previous lesson comments are removed to eliminate clutter._
